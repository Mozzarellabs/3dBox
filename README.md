# 3Dspacegif

Project for [Space Apps Challenge MTL 2015](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/location/montreal).

It's a box that takes 4 simultaneous pictures and generates a 3D space GIF. 

The result is inspired by [FourRealz](http://fourrealz.tumblr.com).

The bracket (work in progress) can be found [here](https://tinkercad.com/things/6PWv4qdSrNn).
